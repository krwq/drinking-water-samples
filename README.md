# Samples for training ML model

- Samples contain day, time, weight reading, accelerometer data (1.0 means gravity, whichever dimension has 1 it means it's the most significant one)
- Samples are recorded following way:
  - weight is calibrated that 0 means empty glass
  - start recording when glass is on weight
  - do specific action
  - put glass back on weight
  - some actions may be recorded without lifting glass
